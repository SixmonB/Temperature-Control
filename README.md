# Temperature-Control
This was a team project for the System Power Interface course in university. It consists of a system with a heater resistor and a sensor to measure voltage according to the changes in temperature.
We used a Nucleos Development board with STM32CubeIDE software for the configuration and tuning. Then we added an interface made with the PyQt library so as to connect the IHM to the working code and command
the system from there.
